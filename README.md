## Description 
This application uses NodeJS in the command line (PC) or terminal (Mac) to prompt the user with questions for entering employees on an IT team. There are three employee categories to choose from: Manager, Engineer, and Intern. Name, id, and email are asked for all employee types. However other questions are specific to the type of employee. For instance, a Manager will be asked to enter an office number, while an Engineer will be asked for their GitHub username, and an Intern will be asked for the school they attended. The user can enter as many employees as they want. When they are done, the application uses the data and compiles it into an html file and exports it into the output directory in the user's Develop directory of their application. The user can then view the result team.html page in their browser.
